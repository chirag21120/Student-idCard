# Student-idCard
This is an app made using flutter framework. As we need a physical idCard for checkin and checkout in our campus and to show as a proof in the campus. So to reduce the hassle of carrying one more card we can use this app which contains our idCard and has a Qr code containing our information that can be scanned for checkin and checkout.
The data is stored on firebase.
